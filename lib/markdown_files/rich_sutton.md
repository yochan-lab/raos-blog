**tldr; it is not that imitation has no role, but that imitation without experience will have fundamental limitations.**

IMHO, the right lens to parse 
[@RichardSSutton](https://x.com/RichardSSutton)
  interview is

"Imitating when you have a world model"

vs

"Imitation is your world model"

The former is taking advice; the latter leads to cargo cults.

We imitate/take advice on top of our own lived experience of the world; our world models are a composite of the two. LLMs have no separate lived experience.
