#SundayHarangue

Some folks tend to stress about the "what if it falls into the wrong hands?" aspect of open source #AI. But for every such worry, there are the oh so many "imagine when it falls into the right hands!" reasons to be sanguine.

Open sourcing a model--instead of licensing access--is lot like teaching people to fish vs. giving them (right to buy) fish.

I am no big fish eater (ok, can't stand 'em), but it is clear the former allows for more people to get piscine-sufficient.. 

While you can still choose to be tormented with "but won't people over fish and cause ocean apocalypse if we teach them to fish?" worries, you can also come to terms with the fact that in a world of multi-polar value systems and rogue states and actors of all kinds, stopping open sourcing only slows down the good guys/uses--the bad guys/uses will find a way anyway..
