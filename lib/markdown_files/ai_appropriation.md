#SundayHarangue 

Many reasonable people have strong opinions about the entry of AI Models (LLMs, VLMs) into the human artistic sphere--specifically in terms of them usurping artistic agency from humans. The (IMHO well deserved) blow back on the 4o Studio Ghibli shenanigans are a case in point. 

As much as I empathize with that point of view, I also wonder whether what they are objecting to is

(1) the part that AI models are being trained massively on human footprints/artistic outputs (e.g. the Studio Ghibli) 

or

(2) the part that they are able to equal human creativity, at least in the eyes of average humans.

In particular, would our disapproval be as severe if AI systems reached artistic heights similar to humans--but without directly and so brazenly being dependent on the human footprints (e.g. without web-scale training on all human output).

If the former, then we are only critical of the creativity by massive training without consent part. 

If the latter, we are saying that we shouldn't even try to create AI systems that rival humans in certain spheres, even in a future where AI systems are either judged as genuinely creative without being derivative, or at least become radically sample efficient to avoid the copyright concerns (after all even human artists do sample *some* of the outputs of other human artists). This is a more difficult to justify position. Granted I wouldn't want AI systems to replace human empathy in inter-human relationships, but in terms of other non-inter-human-interaction capabilities,  after all humanity has always created systems that do better than us in various narrow spheres--be they calculators or bulldozers or rockets, and whether or not they displace some of the human creators from those spheres.
