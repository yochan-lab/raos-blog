"Encyclopedic knowledge" and "Deep thinking" are both equally hard (and thus equally  impressive) in humans; but the former should be viewed as much less impressive in LLMs. #SundayHarangue

We are equally impressed by the fact that a doctor is able to connect seemingly unconnected symptoms in coming up with a diagnosis, as we are of a mathematician proving a narrow but deep theorem. 

A direct transfer of this value system to LLMs doesn't make sense.

LLMs have no memory (or training time) limitations, and have been trained on the entire digital footprint of the humanity. So, for them, the ability to make (heuristic) connections across disparate areas is par for the course. The reasoning part (or lack there-of) should thus get much more scrutiny..
