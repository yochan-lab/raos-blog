"For instance, when I make an eval, I usually offer to run it for other people on their models. If their model does well, they’ll like the eval and promote it."

Another one is to insist on evaluating LLMs only on  tasks for which there are no external verifiers 'cuz "real world (TM) tasks don't have external verifiers". 

This convenient excuse helps the community willfully overlook the obvious LLM limitations..
